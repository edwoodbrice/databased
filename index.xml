      <description>Reflecting on Summer  Putting my Google Maps Data to Work  Where I Went  Where to Next?    Reflecting on Summer  It’s October! And just like that, summer is gone and the fall has already set in. 🍂 So much has happened over the past few sunny months that I’m actually in disbelief. I graduated from college, enrolled in graduate school, started working at MassMutual as a Junior Data Scientist, settled into a couple good books, cooked a ton of awesome meals in my new apartment (‼️), won a VR headset contest, and generally just lived my best life in the sun.</description>

      <description>Looking Back The Response What’s Next?   Looking Back It has been nearly three weeks since the STEM AP “Ask Me Anything” Event. Nevertheless, I can’t stop thinking about what happened.
First of all, it was a great success. After the last words were said and contact information was exchanged, I left the event filling full. No, it wasn’t the pizza. I was full of happiness. Positivity. Fulfillment.</description>

      <description>Every data analysis has an underlying story. From successes and surprises to what worked and what did not, DataBased is meant to capture and convey the journey from start to finish.
It is also meant to showcase the fact that data science is not necessarily a linear or isolated experience. Along the way, events, related projects, milestones and new experiences will naturally sprout up and impact perception and one&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the world around them.</description>
