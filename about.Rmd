From successes and surprises to what worked and what did not, DataBased is meant to help capture and convey my data science journey.

It is also meant to showcase the fact that data science is not necessarily a linear or isolated experience. Along the way, events, related projects, milestones and new experiences will naturally sprout up and impact my perception and understanding of it. Consequently, all of those things---and so much more---matter to this blog too.

Thank you for taking your time to read my blog. I hope you will grow along with me. ðŸŒ±
